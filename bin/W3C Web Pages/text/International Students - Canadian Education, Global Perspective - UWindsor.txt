             Ways to Apply 
             There are three ways to apply to the University of Windsors undergraduate programs: 
              
               
                
                  Apply Directly to UWindsor

                  You reside OUTSIDE of Canada or the United States 
                  You are NOT a Canadian citizen or permanent resident 
                  You are NOT currently attending an Ontario secondary school in Ontario or abroad 
                  The only Ontario university to which you are applying is UWindsor

                  Apply via the Ontario Universities Application Centre (OUAC)   
                
                
                 
                 Use this application if: 
                  
                  You are NOT currently attending an Ontario secondary school

                  Apply through an Authorized Educational Agent   
                
                
                 
                 Open a full listing of our agents and the countries they represent. 
                 If you do not see your country on this list, please contact us at agent@uwindsor.ca. 
                 NOTE: You DO NOT need to meet the English proficiency requirements at the time of application. The University of Windsor provides conditional letters of admission for students who do not meet the English proficiency requirement with the intent the student will satisfy the requirement by participating in our English Pathway Program (ELIP) or by another means prior to starting their academic program. 
                 
                
               
               
              Recommended Application Deadlines 
              Recommended application deadlines for UWindsors undergraduate programs are: 
               
               May 1 for September admissions (Fall) 
               Sept 1 for January admissions (Winter) 
               Jan 1 for May admissions (Spring) 
               
              The above application deadlines are recommended to best ensure your program choice is available and enough time is available for student VISA processing. UWindsor does, however, admit qualified students after the deadlines listed above, if the program has available space. 
               
              Admission Requirements 
              Admission requirements for UWindsors undergraduate programs can be found in our Academic Calendar. 
               
              What to Expect Next 
              After submitting your application form, you can expect to receive an application acknowledgement email within five business days. This email will include instructions for (1) activating your UWin Account and (2) accessing UWinsite Student, UWindsors student information platform.  
              Once you have accessed UWinsite Student, you will need to respond to the items in your To Do List, including uploading the following documents: 
               
               Your official senior secondary education diploma* 
               Your official senior secondary education transcripts* 
               Your official post-secondary education diploma (if applicable)* 
               Your official post-secondary education transcripts (if applicable)* 
               Proof of your English language proficiency 
               Your Portfolio (if applicable) 
               Course descriptions* (only required if you are also applying for credit transfer) 
               
              * Translation is needed if the official documents are not in English and must be provided by an official translation service such as: (1) World Educational Service or (2) International Education Research Foundation. 
              After your documents have been received, they will be verified by UWindsors Office of the Registrar and the items on your To Do List in UWinsite Student marked as Completed. 
              It is only at this point  when all your documentation has been submitted and is in order  that evaluation of your application will begin. Evaluation, if there are no unique circumstances which require further analysis, may take up to four weeks.  
              You can monitor the status of your application in UWinsite Student. You will also be notified by email when a decision has been made.

                 If you do not see your country on this list, please contact us at agent@uwindsor.ca. 
                 NOTE: You DO NOT need to meet the English proficiency requirements at the time of application. The University of Windsor provides conditional letters of admission for students who do not meet the English proficiency requirement with the intent the student will satisfy the requirement by participating in our English Pathway Program (ELIP) or by another means prior to starting their academic program. 
                 
                
               
               
              Recommended Application Deadlines 
              Recommended application deadlines for UWindsors certificate programs are: 
               
               May 1 for September admissions (Fall) 
               Sept 1 for January admissions (Winter) 
               Jan 1 for May admissions (Spring) 
               
              The above application deadlines are recommended to best ensure your program choice is available and enough time is available for student VISA processing. UWindsor does, however, admit qualified students after the deadlines listed above, if the program has available space. 
               
              Admission Requirements 
              Admission requirements for UWindsors certificate programs can be found in our Academic Calendar.

              Once you have accessed UWinsite Student, you will need to respond to the items in your To Do List, including uploading the following documents: 
               
               Your official senior secondary education diploma*

              After your documents have been received, they will be verified by UWindsors Office of the Registrar and the items on your To Do List in UWinsite Student marked as Completed.  
              It is only at this point  when all your documentation has been submitted and is in order  that evaluation of your application will begin. Evaluation, if there are no unique circumstances which require further analysis, may take up to four weeks.

          My University of Windsor experience has been exceptional. The teaching is incredible with amazing engineering facilities and superior support from faculty members. For a final year project or a simple question in the class, a faculty member will always help. The campus is so vibrant that I never feel like Im away from home.

          The International Students Centre (ISC) helped ease the transition when coming to the University of Windsor. The ISC often hosts events for international students to get acquainted, share their experiences and learn about Canadian culture. 
          Staying in residence was also helpful with the transition to Canada. I was able to connect with other students and get familiar with the campus. I even worked for residence services. This enhanced my communication skills and allowed me to gain some valuable work experience.

          I have taken advantage of the services available at the Student Success Centre by booking monthly appointments with my Academic Advisors. These appointments allowed me to speak about my schedule, courses, and time management strategy. Having someone to follow up with my progress was helpful because I improved my skills through the resources provided. This is one of the many UWindsor services that helped me enhance in my academic experience.
