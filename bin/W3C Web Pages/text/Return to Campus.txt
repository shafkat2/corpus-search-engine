               We're prepared for Fall 2021 
                
                As we turn our focus to the Fall 2021 semester to maximize opportunities for on-campus experiences, the University’s top priority continues to remain the health and safety of all of our students, faculty and staff. Robust safety plans and protocols have been in place since the beginning of the pandemic and continue to be enhanced as part of our COVID-19 response. Our approach to planning has been for a safe and measured return to campus life and community, while also remaining flexible, so that we may be responsive to evolving public health guidance. 
                With the return of students, faculty and staff this Fall, a range of health measures will continue to be in place in September, ensuring the health and safety of the UWindsor community. Please review the actions the University is taking below, including: 
                 
                 Non-medical masks or face coverings are required on-campus when entering all campus buildings and common spaces. 
                 Enhanced cleaning will continue daily across campus. 
                 Those coming to campus will be asked to complete the daily self-assessment questionnaire through the Safe Lancer App. 
                 The University promotes the importance of hand-washing and hygiene protocols.
