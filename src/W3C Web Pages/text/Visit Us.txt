               We offer walking student-guided tours Monday to Friday at 1 p.m. except holidays and during the month of December due to final exams. If you book two weeks in advance, we can arrange for you to speak with a professor (academic advising) in the program that interests you. 
               We offer Saturday tours at 1 p.m. during the months of October, November, March and May. Please note that we do not offer academic advising on Saturdays. 
               Our UWindsor Student Ambassador will be able to answer general questions regarding the campus, student life and our programs. 
               Plan to allow about one and a half hours for your tour and please dress for the weather as the tour will go ahead rain or shine.
