        "I wouldn’t trade my time in the Law & Politics program for anything. The incredible professors I met and experiences I had paved the way for my path forward. Working on research with some of our professors inspired me to aim for a career in academia. I also took advantage of the courses taught in French at the faculty and am currently taking almost all of my law courses at McGill in French, which I don’t think I would have been able to do had it not been for the vocabulary and writing skills gained in those French-language Political Science classes."
