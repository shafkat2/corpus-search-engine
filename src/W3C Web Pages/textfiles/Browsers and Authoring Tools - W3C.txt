The web's usefulness and growth depends on its universality. We should be able to publish regardless of the software we use, the computer we have, the language we speak, whether we are wired or wireless, regardless of our sensory or interaction modes. We should be able to access the web from any kind of hardware that can connect to the Internet – stationary or mobile, small or large. W3C facilitates this listening and blending via international web standards. These standards ensure that all the crazy brilliance continues to improve a web that is open to us all.

Announcing The Unicode Standard, Version 7.0



17 June
2014

from 

Internationalization Activity Blog » w3cWebUserAgents




Version 7.0
of the Unicode Standardis now available, adding 2,834 new
characters. This latest version adds the new currency symbols for
the Russian ruble and Azerbaijani manat, approximately 250 emoji
(pictographic symbols), many other symbols, and 23 new lesser-used
and historic scripts, as well as character additions to many
existing scripts. These additions extend support for written
languages of North America, China, India, other Asian countries,
and Africa. See the link above for full details.Most of the new emoji characters derive from characters in
long-standing and widespread use in Wingdings and Webdings
fonts.Major enhancements were made to the Indic script properties. New
property values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach to
rendering Indic scripts. These include properties for joining
behavior, new classes for numbers, and a further division of the
syllabic categories of viramas and rephas. With these enhancements,
the default rendering for newly added Indic scripts can be
significantly improved.Unicode character properties were extended to the new
characters. The old characters have enhancements to Script and
Alphabetic properties, and casing and line-breaking behavior. There
were also nearly 3,000 new Cantonese pronunciation entries, as well
as new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperable
implementations.Two other important Unicode specifications are maintained in
synchrony with the Unicode Standard, and have updates for Version
7.0. These will be released at the same time:
UTS #10,
Unicode Collation Algorithm— the standard for sorting Unicode
text

UTS #46,
Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing— for processing of
non-ASCII URLs (IDNs)






Last Call draft published for Encoding spec



06 June
2014

from 

Internationalization Activity Blog » w3cWebUserAgents

A Last Call Working Draft of 

Encodinghas been published.While encodings have been defined to some extent,
implementations have not always implemented them in the same way,
have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealing
with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. This
specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new
implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding
implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations
can converge.The body of this spec is an exact copy of the WHATWG version as
of the date of its publication, intended to provide a stable
reference for other specifications. We are hoping for people to
review the specification and send comments about any technical
areas that need attention (see the Status section for details).Please send comments by 
1 July 2014.
