XML Technologies including XML, XML Namespaces, XML Schema, XSLT, Efficient XML Interchange (EXI), and other related standards.




   
      
         
            XML Essentials 
            
         
         
        XML is shouldered by a set of essential technologies such as the
        infoset and namespaces. They address issues when using XML in
        specific applications contexts.
      
      
      
         
            Schema 
            
         
         
        Formal descriptions of vocabularies create flexibility in
        authoring environments and quality control chains. W3C’s XML Schema,
	SML, and data binding technologies provide the tools for quality
	control of XML data.
      
      
      
         
            Security 
            
         
         
        Manipulating data with XML requires sometimes integrity,
        authentication and privacy. XML signature, encryption, and
	xkms can help create a secure environment for XML.
      
      
   
   
      
         
            Transformation 
            
         
         
	  Very frequently one wants to transform XML content
	  into other formats (including other XML formats).
	  XSLT and XPath are very powerful tools for
	  creating different
        representations of XML content.
      
      
      
         
            Query 
            
         
         
        XQuery (supported by XPath)
	is a query language for XML to extract data, similar
        to the role of SQL for databases, or SPARQL for the Semantic
	Web.
      
      
      
         
            Components 
            
         
         
        The XML ecosystem is using additional tools to create a
        richer environment for using and manipulating XML
        documents. These components include style sheets, xlink
	xml:id, xinclude, xpointer, xforms, xml fragments, and
	events.
      
      
   
   
      
         
            Processing 
            
         
         
        A processing model defines what
        operations should be performed in what order
	on an XML document.
      
      
      
         
            Internationalization 
            
         
         
        W3C has worked with the community on the internationalization
	of XML, for instance for specifying the language of XML content.
      
      
      
         
            Publishing 
            
         
         
XML grew out of the technical publication community.
       Use XSL-FO to publish even large
       or complex multilingual XML
       documents to HTML, PDF or other
       formats; include SVG diagrams
       and MathML formulas in the output.

Announcing The Unicode Standard, Version 7.0



17 June
2014

from 

Internationalization Activity Blog » w3cXMLCore




Version 7.0
of the Unicode Standardis now available, adding 2,834 new
characters. This latest version adds the new currency symbols for
the Russian ruble and Azerbaijani manat, approximately 250 emoji
(pictographic symbols), many other symbols, and 23 new lesser-used
and historic scripts, as well as character additions to many
existing scripts. These additions extend support for written
languages of North America, China, India, other Asian countries,
and Africa. See the link above for full details.Most of the new emoji characters derive from characters in
long-standing and widespread use in Wingdings and Webdings
fonts.Major enhancements were made to the Indic script properties. New
property values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach to
rendering Indic scripts. These include properties for joining
behavior, new classes for numbers, and a further division of the
syllabic categories of viramas and rephas. With these enhancements,
the default rendering for newly added Indic scripts can be
significantly improved.Unicode character properties were extended to the new
characters. The old characters have enhancements to Script and
Alphabetic properties, and casing and line-breaking behavior. There
were also nearly 3,000 new Cantonese pronunciation entries, as well
as new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperable
implementations.Two other important Unicode specifications are maintained in
synchrony with the Unicode Standard, and have updates for Version
7.0. These will be released at the same time:
UTS #10,
Unicode Collation Algorithm— the standard for sorting Unicode
text

UTS #46,
Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing— for processing of
non-ASCII URLs (IDNs)






Workshop report: Summary of the LD4LT group kickoff / LIDER
roadmapping workshop



11 June
2014

from 

Internationalization Activity Blog » w3cXMLCore

The 
LIDER project has
published a report on the first 
Linked Data for
Language Technology event, which was held 21st March in
alignment with the European Data Forum in Athens. 

Read the report.Industry stakeholders from many areas (localization, publishing,
language technology applications etc.) and key researchers from
linked data and language technology discussed promises and
challenges around linguistic linked data. The report summarizes all
presentations and includes an initial list of use cases and
requirements for linguistic linked data. This and the overall
outcome of the event will feed into work of the 
LD4LT group (see
especially the 

LD4LT latest draft version of use cases), and the field of
multilingual linked data in general.The 
LD4LT group is part
of the MultilingualWeb community – learn more about 
related
projects.






Last Call draft published for Encoding spec



06 June
2014

from 

Internationalization Activity Blog » w3cXMLCore

A Last Call Working Draft of 

Encodinghas been published.While encodings have been defined to some extent,
implementations have not always implemented them in the same way,
have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealing
with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings. This
specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new
implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding
implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations
can converge.The body of this spec is an exact copy of the WHATWG version as
of the date of its publication, intended to provide a stable
reference for other specifications. We are hoping for people to
review the specification and send comments about any technical
areas that need attention (see the Status section for details).Please send comments by 
1 July 2014.
